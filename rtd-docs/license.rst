License Activation
==================

To unlock the full potential of iGelGiz and ensure you receive ongoing updates and support, activating your license key is essential.

Why Activate Your License?
--------------------------
*   **Full Feature Access:** Some features may be limited or unavailable without an active license.
*   **Plugin Updates:** Receive the latest security patches, feature enhancements, and compatibility updates.
*   **Support:** Gain access to priority support channels (depending on your license tier).

How to Activate Your License
----------------------------
1.  **Navigate to the iGelGiz Settings Page.**
    After installing and activating the iGelGiz plugin, find "iGelGiz" in your WordPress admin sidebar and click on it.

2.  **Locate the License Activation Form.**
    If your license is not yet active, you will typically see a prominent section or tab prompting you to enter your license key. This is often labeled "License," "Activate License," or similar.

3.  **Enter Your License Key.**
    Copy the license key you received upon purchasing iGelGiz and paste it into the designated "License Key" field.

4.  **Click "Activate License".**
    Submit the form. The plugin will attempt to connect to the iGelGiz licensing server to verify and activate your key.

Confirmation
------------
Once the license is successfully activated, the page will update to show your license status as "Active" or "Valid." You may also see additional details such as your plan name, expiry date (if applicable), and the number of activations left.

Troubleshooting License Activation
----------------------------------
If you encounter issues during license activation:

*   **Check Your Internet Connection:** Ensure your WordPress site can make outbound connections to the internet. Firewalls or server configurations might sometimes block this.
*   **Verify Your License Key:** Double-check that you have copied and pasted the license key correctly, without any extra spaces or characters.
*   **Item ID Mismatch:** The plugin attempts to activate against a list of valid product IDs. If your key is for a different product or an old version, it might fail. Ensure you have the correct plugin version for your key.
*   **No Activations Left:** Your license key might have a limit on the number of sites it can be activated on. If you've reached this limit, you may need to deactivate it from another site or upgrade your license.
*   **Expired License:** If your license has expired (for non-lifetime licenses), you'll need to renew it.
*   **API Errors:** If the licensing server is temporarily unavailable, please try again after a few minutes.

If problems persist, refer to the :doc:`support` section for assistance.

Managing Your License
---------------------
On the iGelGiz settings page (usually under a "License Status" tab if active), you will typically find options to:
*   View your current license details.
*   Deactivate the license from the current site (e.g., if you are moving your site or no longer wish to use the plugin on it).
